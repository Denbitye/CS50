        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            <li><b>Keep your dog on a leash in public places</b></li>
            <p align="justify">Even if your dog is well trained an well behaved, always keep him or her on a leash when
                you walk
                in
                a public place. Dogs may be distracted by unexpected noises or activities or may be drawn to
                something further away from you.
                Just imagine what could happen if your pet wants to see what’s going on across the street as a
                car
                speeds by? With your dog on a leash you have control over where he or she goes, and it also
                allows
                you to keep your pet away from people, or other animals, who may be afraid of dogs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
            <li><b>Never allow your dog to wander off alone</b></li>
            <p align="justify">Never allow your dear pup to walk away without you. There are many hazards that could
                await once
                your
                pet is away from your property or out of your sight. Some people may not appreciate having a
                unknown
                dog wandering around their garden, even if it is friendly and well-behaved. As an owner, it’s
                your
                responsibility to make sure that your pet stays where he or she is allowed to be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            <li><b>Basic commands and obedience training</b></li>
            <p align="justify">We teach our children important, basic commands to keep them safe and stop them from
                running out
                in
                front of a car or putting something dangerous in their mouth. For the same reasons, dogs should
                also
                be taught certain commands. Whether you take your dog to the park, to the vet or for a simple
                walk,
                dangers can occur, and no dog is smart enough to realize every single danger he can get himself
                into. There are automobiles, open wells, bikes, and he can get trapped in places where he cannot
                get
                out. To ensure your dog is a good citizen and to keep him out of dangerous situations, it is
                extremely important that he learns to understand and obey certain basic commands.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
            <li><b>Be aware that some foods are bad for dogs</b></li>
            <p align="justify">Offering a pet “people food” isn’t just promoting bad pet manners, but it can actually be
                quite
                dangerous for our four-legged friends. As a dog owner you should know the common foods that
                are bad
                for dogs. Most people are aware that chocolate can be very harmful in certain quantities.
                Other
                foods that are potentially toxic to dogs include avocado, onions, garlic, grapes, raisins,
                macadamia
                nuts, raw eggs, candy and anything with caffeine in it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
            <li><b>Check the condition of all your pet’s toys</b></li>
            <p align="justify">You maybe don’t think about it, but old, broken dog toys can be quite dangerous. Make a
                point to
                regularly check your pet’s toys and look for wear and tear. Anything that’s cracked,
                splintered or
                ragged should be thrown away so it doesn’t become a choking hazard.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            <li><b>Your dog needs dental care, too</b></li>
            <p align="justify">Just like you, your pet can suffer from gum disease, tooth loss, and tooth pain. And
                just like you,
                regular brushing and oral cleanings help keep your pet’s teeth strong and healthy.
                Many dogs show
                signs of dental disease by age three, leading to loose teeth, and chronic pain. In
                addition to
                regular dental cleanings by your vet, you also have to give your pet a regular teeth
                cleaning. Owner
                care includes brushing, oral rinses, and dental treats. Your vet is a good source of
                information
                about brushing techniques and dental care.

                We cannot protect our pets from every potentially dangerous situation. But we can
                try!</p>

        <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
            <li><b>Keep your dog mentally and physically health</b>y</li>
            <p align="justify">In order to stay healthy and fit, and to fight disease, dogs need both mental and
                physical
                stimulation on a daily basis. A normal healthy dog will benefit from 2 exercise
                sessions a day.
                Off-leash exercises in the garden, playtime in the park, swimming, running and
                walking are all
                perfect ways to keep your pup in shape. But don’t forget mental stimulation!
                Mental training
                sessions keep a dog’s brain sharp, as well as help develop and strengthen the
                bond between dog and
                human. Try to make it fun (for both of you) and avoid boring or repetitive
                activities. You can try
                teaching your dog tricks and commands, or agility exercises. Short training
                sessions are best,
                intermingled with play or rest sessions and lots of praise and love.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
            <li><b>Put away all dangerous, chewable items</b></li>
            <p align="justify">If something is potentially dangerous for your pet to put in his or her mouth
                (wires, scissors, glue,
                medicine), move it to a higher elevation or put it in closet or drawer. A
                dog that hasn’t shown
                interest in an object yet may get bored and seek it out later when you’re
                not around. When an item
                is kept out of your dog’s reach, then he or she will be far less likely to
                chew on it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
            <li> <b>Make a dog first aid kit</b></li>
            <p align="justify">A dog first aid kit is very important to have at home or to bring when
                you go on holiday. Your kit
                should include the same kinds of things you would expect in a kit made
                for humans, such as gauze,
                medical tape, an antiseptic product, hydrogen peroxide, thermometer,
                your pet’s medical records and
                contact information for his or her vet and nearby emergency clinics.

                Keep your pet’s first-aid kit in your home and take it with you if you
                are traveling with your pet.
