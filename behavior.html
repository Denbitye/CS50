                    often
                    pleased that their dog barks, because it alerts them to the approach of people to their home or
                    it tells them there’s something that the dog wants or needs. However, sometimes a dog’s barking
                    can be excessive. </div>

                    howl to attract attention, to make contact with others and to announce their presence. Some
                    dogs also howl in response to high-pitched sounds, such as emergency vehicle sirens or
                    musical instruments. Read on to learn what to do if your dog howls excessively.</div>

                    they explore the
                    world. Chewing accomplishes a number of things for a dog. For young dogs, it’s a way to
                    relieve pain that might be caused by incoming teeth. For older dogs, it’s nature’s way
                    of keeping jaws strong and teeth clean. Chewing also combats boredom and can relieve
                    mild anxiety or frustration.</div>

                    Dogs most commonly whine when they’re seeking attention, when they’re excited, when
                    they’re anxious or when they’re trying to appease you.</div>

                <div class="desc"><b>Mouthing, Nipping and Play Biting in Adult Dogs</b>Most pet parents don’t enjoy
                    dogs who bite, chew and mouth their hands, limbs or clothing during play and interaction. The
                    jaws of an adult dog can cause significantly more pain than puppy teeth, and adult dogs can
                    inadvertently cause injury while mouthing. Mouthing is often more difficult to suppress in adult
                    dogs because adults aren’t as sensitive to our reactions as puppies are, and they’re usually
                    more difficult to control physically because of their size.</div>

                <div class="desc"><b>Separation Anxiety:</b> One of the most common complaints of pet parents is
                    that their dogs are disruptive or destructive when left alone. Their dogs might urinate,
                    defecate, bark, howl, chew, dig or try to escape. Although these problems often indicate that a
                    dog needs to be taught polite house manners, they can also be symptoms of distress. </div>

                    for dogs. Wild animals who successfully protect their valuable resources—such as food, mates and living
                    areas—are more likely to survive in the wild than those who don’t. However, we find the tendency to
                    guard valued items undesirable in our domestic pets, especially when the behavior is directed toward
                    people.</div>
