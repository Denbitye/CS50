    <p align="justify">Hi, My name is Mariamawit and I own a dog named Snow! He brings so much
        joy into my life and helps me not to be so bored anymore. Snow keeps me so busy and is a great way for me
        to stop thinking about food all the time and do something fun. I used to feel so lonely and bored and I
        think I ate just because I was bored, not because I was hungry&#129315. But now, Im too busy to eat! I get
        lots more
        exercise with Snow &#128525 When Snow was a pup, he was so shy and conservative.Now Snow is all grown up.
        I make sure Snow goes for walks and that's a great way to make sure that I go
        for walks too. So, we both win! Snow gets exercise and so do I. Because Snow needs exercise everyday, I
        get good exercise too.

        Having Snow makes me feel needed and loved. &#129392 I would recommend getting a pet if you are lonely or bored.
        A
        pet can fill up your day with lots of activity and keeps you more healthy by exercising more. I feel better
        now that I get more exercise and I'm just happier. I don't think about loosing weight, I think about getting
        exercise, being more healthy and enjoying my new friend. </p>
